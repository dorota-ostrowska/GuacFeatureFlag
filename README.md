# 🥑 GuacFeatureFlag 🥑
Welcome to **GuacFeatureFlag**, the most _delicious_ way to demonstrate feature flags! This project blends the creamy smoothness of avocados with the crisp functionality of feature toggles to bring you a tasty tech demo. If you've ever wanted your code to be as adaptable as guacamole at a party, you're in the right place!

## 📋 Features
* **Dynamic Ingredients Scaling**: Adjust the guacamole recipe for 1 to 4 servings (or just eat it all yourself—no judgment).
* **Feature Flag Demo**: Learn how feature flags work using our recipe as an example. Add cilantro? Toggle it! Extra chili? Done!
* **Minimalist Setup**: Built using Flask and plain HTML—no fancy JavaScript frameworks, just simple and tasty code.

## 👩‍🍳 Recipe for Success
Remember, the secret to great guacamole (and great code) is balance:

* 🧂 Too much salt and you ruin the guac.
* 🇲🇽 Too many flags and you ruin the codebase.

Stay balanced, stay fresh, and always taste-test your features before serving!
